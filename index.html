        <h3>Problem Statement:</h3>
        <p>Consider the function f(x)=Sqrt(1+x)−1 at x=1e−15 . This function involves the subtraction of a pair of similar numbers when x is near 0 and the results are significantly erroneous in this region. Using pow instead of sqrt doesn’t give better results. A “good” answer is 4.99999999999999875...∗1e−16 . The task is to modify f(x) to give a good approximation of f(x) in the neighborhood of 0.</p>
        <h3>Solution:</h3>
        <pre><code class="language-vbnet">
            Imports System
            Public Module ApproxFloat
                Public Function f(ByVal x As Double) As Double
                    ' use Taylor series
                    Return x / 2 - x^2 / 8 + x^3/16
                End Function
            End Module
            </code></pre>
