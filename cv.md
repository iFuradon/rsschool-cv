## About Me:  
I am a dedicated and experienced freelancer with a strong background in various programming languages and operating systems. I have a knack for automating complex processes and creating efficient solutions. My goal is to leverage my skills to solve challenging problems and contribute to the success of the projects I work on.

## Skills:

Advanced user of MS Office at the level of automation, statistical data processing (descriptive statistics, modeling including nonlinear)

## Code Samples:  
### Problem Statement:  
Consider the function f(x)=Sqrt(1+x)−1
 at x=1e−15
. This function involves the subtraction of a pair of similar numbers when x is near 0 and the results are significantly erroneous in this region. Using pow instead of sqrt doesn’t give better results. A “good” answer is 4.99999999999999875...∗1e−16
. The task is to modify f(x) to give a good approximation of f(x)  in the neighborhood of 0.
### Solution:  
```VB
Imports System
Public Module ApproxFloat
    Public Function f(ByVal x As Double) As Double
        ' Taylor series
        Return x / 2 - x^2 / 8 + x^3/16
    End Function
End Module
```
